# ⏰ Digital Clock

Welcome to the **Digital Clock** project! This is a simple, beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to create a graphical digital clock using Python's tkinter library.

## 🔧 Installation

Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ubaidalishah/Digital_Clock.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

## 🔄 How It Works

The clock leverages the `tkinter` library for GUI development and the `time` module to fetch and update the current time dynamically. The program uses the `after()` method to refresh the time displayed on the interface every second.

## 📊 Example Output

When you run the script, you will see a graphical window displaying the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
